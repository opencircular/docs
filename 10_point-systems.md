Background on Point Systems (Dividends vs Loyalty Rewards Points)
---------------------------

WIP

Many systems have dividends or rewards systems to incentivise certain consumer behavior.

Citicard has a dividend that incentivises users to use their credit card over competitors cards. Users typically get 1-5% percent cash back on purchases made. Then after a certain amount of time when they hit a threshhold, let say $300, they can request a check. The hidden reason is citi wants more customers, more customers means more profit from two sources (1) from users that hold a balance and paying interest rates (2) from fees harvested from the visa/mastercard network. At the end of the day the consumer ends up footing the bill. They are tricked into thinking they got a free lunch (via the dividend) when in reality the fee is passed back them in the price of consumer goods from retailers and businesses that have to may a fee to use the network. 

Airlines have a miles rewards system. Typically the incentive is for you to exclusivley fly a certain airline to earn loyalty points. The consumer may think they are racking up points and getting free vacations but most of the time they are choosing slightly more expensive flights throughout the year to earn the points (probably because their employer is footing the bill). These points are not tranferable between airlines and lock the consumer into one vendor.

The PlastiPoints reward system is different. We do not want vendor/service provider lock in. We do not want to fee of the reward to raise the price of product (i.e the price of the material). To get into the details we must discuss two finance terms (1) fungible tokens and (2) non-fungible tokens

Fungible Token

The PlastiPoint Reward System aims to be different (its more like a dividend/coupon system)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PlastiPoint Generic Formula
--------------
`Material Value Split Price + Subsidy = Fiat Pegged Reward`

Legend:

- Material Value Split = The Price a drop center (or buyer, like Mr Green) will pay you for the material. For example 14.6 shillings per kg. This could change over time based on market conditions. For instance, it could be 5% of the value of the material in the begining, but as time goes on and the value of the material increases it could drop to 3% (becuase it would convert to more money for the consumers pocket as the material value increase).
- Subsidy = Any additional reward on top of the base value of the material. For example, Coke might pay a 5 shilling per kg subsidy to bootstrap recycling in a region. They also might provide subsidites in the form of a coupon for coke products.
- Fiat Pegged Reward = The total value awarded to the consumer in local currency (ex Shillings). This amount is not nessesarily debited at the time of transaction exchnage. It may be batched in the future and recording as a libility on the Recycling Companies balance sheet. 

Exchange Rate:

The reward in the wallet can be shown in two ways. (1) One way is in the form of a conversion to PlastiPoints. A plastipoint is pegged to a regional currency, such as Shillings, and is used to encourage the user to only spend the rewards on a limted amount number of items, such as a partner product. (2) The second way is to pay the rewards out in cash. This allows the consumer to earn a "divident" like rewards that can be cashed out when a certain threshhold is met (such as every 10 dollars earned in dividends can be cashed out).



Subsidites are temporary and should HOPEFULLY only be used to bootstrap 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Goal
--------
The goal is to create a global effiecient system and incentivise competition to drive the value of the material up (used in more products) and drive the cost of labor to produce and transport the material down. The goal is to not even use reward tokens or subsidies and make the value split of the material pay for itself.
