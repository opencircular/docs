Open Circular Network
====================

The open circular network handles tracking and incentivising the flow of materials in a series on transactions on a distubuted ledger. The network can be broken up
into regions using channels. The channel regions can be ran by anyone (informal/formal, gov/biz/individual). 

In the past legacy systems were okay at tracking large flows of material via shipping port and keeping import and export data. The problem with that system is you have no data
or incentive to flow material from the local consumers to larger aggregation points, then to recycling centers, then to global ports (if needed). it also lead to cartels running
centralized facilies. 

The problem is in informal systems most of flow of materials happen on the ground at the local level.
