Open Circular Network
====================

The Open Circular Network handles:
- Tracking and incentivising the flow of materials 
- Matchmaking: matching consumers with recycling to collectors/recycling centers (Smart Route Matchmaking Protocol)

Legacy System
-------------
In the past legacy systems were okay at tracking large flows of material via shipping ports. If you are a company that needs to move an item you typically call up a central company. The central company aggrates your shipping request with many other companies. Eventually when the size of the shipment reached a threshhold it was shipped. This resulted in a monopoly of  import and export data. The problem with this system is that it does not include the local consumer and does not stimulate local entrepreneurial businesses to organically form. He does not have access to this central database. He is usually part of an informal system in regards to recycled material. In this system there is no incentive to enable a flow of material from the local consumers to larger aggregation points, then to recycling centers, then to global ports (if needed..keep it local if possible). It also lead to cartels running centralized facilies. 

Future System
-------------
The solution is simple. Don't store all that data on a database system that is owned by one company. Instead, save that data on a distributed ledger that is ran by many companies and individuals in regions all around the world. The network can be broken up into regions using channels. The channel regions can be ran by anyone (informal/formal, gov/business/NGO/individual). 

The Open Circular Network tries to solve this problem. The enabling technology is the "Smart Route Matchmaking Protocol". It can be broken down into the following components running as smart contracts on a distributed ledger:
- Request Orderbook
- Smart Route Queue
- Tracing Ledger
- Rewards Balance
- Collectors Pool
- Recycling Center Exchange Rates
- Reputation Ratings
